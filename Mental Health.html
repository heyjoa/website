    <h2>Mental Health Disorders</h2>
    <p>A mental health disorder is characterised by a considerable change in a person's behaviour, emotions, and more. There are many different types of mental disorders,
        and below are some examples of the most common ones.
        <h3>Anxiety</h3>
        <p>Anxiety is a common mental disorder of which a person experiences excessive fear and worry. These feelings can deeply affect a person's every day life, which is
            why it is important to get a diagnosis as they may be options to help. There are multiple types of anxiety, including but not limited to generalized anxiety, social anxiety,
            panic disorder (panic attacks,) and seperation anxiety (struggling with seperation from an individual a person has a strong emotional bong with).

        <h3>Depression</h3>
        <p>Depression is a disorder where individuals with it suffer with depressive episodes, which can last anywhere from a few days to multiple weeks. During these depressive episodes
        the person tends to feel sad and empty for most of their day, almost every day of the period. This can cause feelings of guilt, low self-worth, hopelessness for the future,
        suicidal thoughts, low energy, poor sleep quality and more. Depression is a very painful disorder, however, there are options for remedies in the form of medications or
        psychological treatment.</p>
        <h3>Eating Disorders</h3>
        <p>Eating disorders affect a person's will to eat food, as people with eating disorders often have prominent concerns about their body shape and weight. It can cause a person to
        eat less, avoid eating completely, exessive exercise, or even induce vomiting upon themself. There are some options for treatment though, which include cognitive and family based
        treatment.</p>
