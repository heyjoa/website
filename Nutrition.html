    <h1>Nutrition</h1>
    <p>Nutrition describes a healthy, balanced and fulfilling diet. Good nutrition fuels your body and is needed to maintain your brain function, muscles, bone, nerves,
        circulation and all the other parts of the body. Good nutrition also prevents sickness and disease.

    <h2>What does a healthy diet look like?</h2>
    <p> A healthy diet is a balanced one that hits all the major food groups. To start off with, all foods are made up of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and also vitamins 
        and minerals. These components are all very important for a nutritional diet, and to get all of the components in your body, be sure to eat enough of the following
        foods every day. To the right is the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, which provides many examples of foods of each main food group, very helpful if you need
        some ideas for healthy options. </p>

    <p>Now, these are general rules of what you get in foods and such, but if you are buying something premade or want more specific details, then you can look at food labels.
        Food labels are found on the back of all stored food products at supermarkets and stuff, and they give you lots of information on specific the macronutrients and
        micronutrients (carbs, proteins, fibres, minerals and vitamins) in foods. Below is a guide that breaksdown the different parts of a food label to make it easier
        to understand.
